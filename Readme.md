# Android App for ordering Coffee

This is a simple android app for ordering coffee. You can select between various toppings and a quantity. The price will adjust to your selection. When you hit the order-button, your order will be forwarded to your an e-mail app of your choice, so you can send your order.

The app was made during the android nanodegree course at udacity: https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803

I did not stick to the code of the original, but modified it to my liking. See the original code here:
